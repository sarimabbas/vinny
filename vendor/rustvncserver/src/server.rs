//! VNC server implementation for managing client connections and framebuffer distribution.
//!
//! This module provides the main VNC server functionality, including:
//! - TCP listener for incoming client connections
//! - Client session management
//! - Event routing between clients and the application layer
//! - VNC repeater support for reverse connections
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The server uses an event-driven architecture where:
//! - Each client runs in its own asynchronous task
//! - Client events (keyboard, mouse, clipboard) are forwarded to the application via channels
//! - The framebuffer automatically notifies all clients of screen changes
//! - Server events (connect/disconnect) are emitted for the application to handle

    /// TCP connection are properly closed. The order of operations is critical to avoid orphaned
    /// connections:
    ///
    /// 1. **Abort all client tasks** - Signals all message handler and event handler tasks to cancel
    /// 2. **Wait for tasks to exit** - Blocks until tasks complete, ensuring their `Arc<VncClient>`
    ///    references are dropped
    /// 3. **Clear client lists** - Removes the final `Arc<VncClient>` references from the server's
    ///    client list, causing `VncClient` to drop and automatically close the read half of the
    ///    TCP connection
    /// 4. **Close write halves** - Explicitly calls `shutdown()` on the write halves to close the
    ///    write side of the TCP connection
    ///
    /// After this sequence completes, both sides of the TCP connection are closed and the client
    /// will receive a disconnect notification.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    ///
    /// - The caller should wrap this in a timeout to prevent indefinite blocking
    /// - The caller is responsible for calling Java-side cleanup (e.g., removing cursors) before
    ///   invoking this method
    /// - All client IDs, task handles, and write streams are cleared from their respective lists
